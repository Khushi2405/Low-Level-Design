# Low-Level Design Repository

Welcome to the **Low-Level Design (LLD)** repository! 🎨 This repository contains detailed design documents, categorized design patterns, case studies, and solutions to various system design problems.

---

## 🚀 About This Repository

This repository focuses on documenting:
- Object-Oriented Design principles, including **SOLID principles**.
- Categorized design patterns.
- System workflows and architecture.
- Case studies of real-world systems and problems.

Each design includes problem statements, class diagrams, code implementations, and detailed explanations.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following sections:

### 1. **Design Principles**
A dedicated section for Object-Oriented Design principles, including:
- **SOLID Principles**:
  - **S**: Single Responsibility Principle  
  - **O**: Open/Closed Principle  
  - **L**: Liskov Substitution Principle  
  - **I**: Interface Segregation Principle  
  - **D**: Dependency Inversion Principle  

Each principle is accompanied by examples, diagrams, and code to illustrate its importance and application.

### 2. **Design Patterns**
Design patterns are grouped by their categories:

#### **Creational Patterns**
Patterns that deal with object creation:
<!-- - Singleton  -->
- Factory Method  
- Abstract Factory  
<!-- - Builder  
- Prototype --> 

#### **Structural Patterns**
Patterns that focus on the composition and structure of classes or objects:
<!-- - Adapter  
- Bridge  
- Composite  -->
- Decorator  
<!-- - Facade  
- Flyweight  
- Proxy  -->

#### **Behavioral Patterns**
Patterns that manage communication and interaction between objects:
<!-- - Chain of Responsibility  
- Command  
- Interpreter  
- Iterator  
- Mediator  
- Memento  -->
- Observer  
<!-- - State  -->
- Strategy  
<!-- - Template Method  
- Visitor --> 

Each pattern includes:
- Problem definition.
- Class diagrams and relationships.
- Sample code implementation.

### 3. **Case Studies**
Detailed low-level designs of real-world systems:
<!-- - **Elevator System**  -->
- **Parking Lot System**  
<!-- - **Library Management System**  
- **Online Shopping Cart**  
- **Food Delivery System (like Swiggy/Zomato)**  
- **ATM System**  
- **Chess Game**  
- **Tic-Tac-Toe**  -->
